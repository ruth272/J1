## 1. What is fault localization? Provide your answer using at least one bolded phrase using markdown.
Fault localization is the **process of tracing throught your code to find an error that causes an incorrect output**.
## 2. Three benefits of Test Driven Development are:
- your code does not cause bias for your tests 
- writing your tests first helps you plan for how you can write your code
- writing tests helps you see what requirements your code will need
## 3. Input domain partitions:
- It must have at least one number.
    * valid: any number including and between 0-9
    * invalid: does not include a number
- It must have at least one uppercase letter.
    * valid: any alphabetic letter that is uppercase
    * invalid: does not have any uppercased letter
- It must have at least one lowercase letter.
    * valid: any alphabetic letter that is lower case
    * invalid: does not have any lowercase letter
- It must not contain the website gmail anywhere. (For example if we were generating a password for gmail accounts)
    * valid: does not have the substring "gmail" anywhere
    * invalid: contains the "gmail" substring
- It can only be made up of letters, numbers, and the underscore.
    * valid: has an alphabetic letter or number between 0-9 or and underscore symbol(_)
    * invalid: has special characters that are not an underscore (! or @ or # or $ or % or ^ or & or * or () or - or + or = or {} or [] or \ or | or ; or : or ' or " or <> or ? or / or . or ,)
## 4. if ( ( (a > b) or G ) and (x < y) )
| a > b |   G   | x < y | Predicate Outcome | Cluase Responsible |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| true  | true  | true  | true              | (a>b) & (G) & (x<y)|
| true  | true  | false | false             | x<y                |
| true  | false | true  | true              | (a>b) & (x<y)      |
| true  | false | false | fasle             | x<y                |
| false | true  | true  | true              | (G) & (x<y)        |
| false | true  | false | false             | (a>b) & (x<y)      |
| false | false | true  | false             | (a>b) & (G)        |
| false | false | false | false             | (a>b) & (G) & (x<y)|
## 5. Consider the control flow graph below. What are all the paths (using node numbers) that would achieve full path coverage as a test criteria? Is this a finite set?
---

Path 1: 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7

Path 2: 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 7

Path 3: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7

Path 4: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7

Path 5: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7

Path 6: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7

This is a finite set.
